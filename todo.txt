Ok, I think what I need to do to deal with the issue of resizing is make it
that the content is always rendered onto an intermediate surface which is of
the game's logical screen size. Then, we render that surface onto the actual
screen surface so that it maintains it's aspect ratio but fills the screen
or close enough.
